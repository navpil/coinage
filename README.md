# coinage

Implementation of the Coin Age micro game in Java.

Coin Age is a nice little game which can be played with several coins and a map, which is about a size of a credit card. 
Rules are pretty simple and the game is very portable.

I am not the author of the game itself, this is only its implementation which I wrote just for fun.
The actual author of the game itself is Adam P. McIver

If you are interested in supporting the game authors or would like to read more about it, please have a look at the following links:

You are free to download a source code, build an application and run it.
